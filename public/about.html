<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself Minal,Im just another lazy college student who loves to eat fries and play games."Valorant" one of my favorite
    game, I've spent hundreds of hours playing and mastering it.I just love spending time on valorant with my friends.</p>

<p>For me, gaming isn't just a hobby-it's a way of life.I hope our brown parents would agree with this
      and let me play peacefully.</p>

<p>Further more,I'm (unfortunately) 15.I'm a medical ninja-first year.I loveee eating fries and really dont like
  to share em (fries is a feeling dude).Idk why but i have social anxiety.</p>
  <p>Anyway, yea its me :) </p>
